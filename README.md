# TIA Portal Project with installation guide

This repository contains my first TIA Portal project, along with detailed instructions for setting up the environment and downloading required software in the correct order.  
I must say that its been a while of several trials and fails this is the installation procedure that worked correctly for me.   
Due to lack of correct procedure online i decided to document mine to help those who realy need the software and don't know how to get it.  
The app is seamless and it should be also for you if you follow the given procedures.
